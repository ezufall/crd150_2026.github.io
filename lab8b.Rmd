We go from one form of place-based inequality in the [last lab](https://crd150.github.io/lab8a.html) (segregation) to another form in this lab (gentrification). How do we determine whether a neighborhood is undergoing gentrification? Let's find out using a quantitative approach.  We'll determine which neighborhoods are experiencing gentrification in the City of Fresno, an issue that has gotten a lot of [local attention](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article222458970.html).  


In this guide you will learn how to calculate the measure of gentrification used by Ding et al., (2016). This lab guide follows closely and supplements the material presented in class Handout 9.


<p class="comment">**Assignment 8 is due by 12:00 pm, May 28th on Canvas.**  See [here](https://crd150.github.io/hw_guidelines.html) for assignment guidelines.  You must submit an `.Rmd` file and its associated `.html` file. Name the files: yourLastName_firstInitial_asgn08. For example: brazil_n_asgn08.</p>

## **Open up a R Markdown file**
\

Download the [Lab template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/labtemplate.Rmd) into an appropriate folder on your hard drive (preferably, a folder named 'Lab 8'), open it in R Studio, and type and run your code there.  The template is also located on Canvas under Files.  The template is also located on Canvas under Files.  Change the title ("Lab 8b") and insert your name and date. Don't change anything else inside the YAML (the stuff at the top in between the `---`).  Also keep the grey chunk after the YAML. For a rundown on the use of R Markdown, see the [assignment guidelines](https://crd150.github.io/hw_guidelines.html).

## **Installing and loading packages**
\

We will not be using any new packages in this lab. You’ll need to load the following packages. Unlike installing, you will always need to load packages whenever you start a new R session. As such, you’ll always need to use `library()` in your R Markdown file.

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(tigris)
library(tmap)
library(rmapshaper)
library(flextable)
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Bringing in the data**
\


We will use the Ding et al. (2016) method outlined in Handout 9 for measuring gentrification.  The measure defines gentrification as follows

* A neighborhood is eligible for gentrification if its median household income is less than the city's median household income at the beginning of the observation period.
* An eligible neighborhood gentrifies if its change from the beginning to the end of the  observation period in median gross rent *or* median housing value is greater than the change in the city *and* the change in its percent of residents that have a college degree is more than the change in the city.

We will define the beginning of the period using 2006-2010 ACS data (this is the first ACS period using 2010 tract boundaries) and the end of the period using 2015-2019 ACS data. We need to bring in the appropriate variables from each of these years into R.

To demonstrate this measure, we will examine gentrification in the [City of Fresno](https://www.fresno.gov/) in California. We need to collect data at the tract and city levels.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Tract level data**
\

Gentrification is a neighborhood socioeconomic change process. So we need to grab socioeconomic data from the beginning and end of the period for census tracts (the most common measure of neighborhood in the social sciences). 

First, we will need to read in tract-level median gross rent, median housing value and percent with a college degree for Fresno city census tracts in the beginning of the period (2006-2010).  We will use the `get_acs()` command to get these data. We won't go through each line of code in detail because we've covered most of these operations and functions in prior labs.  We've embedded comments within the code that briefly explains what each chunk is doing. Go back to prior guides (or RDS/GWR) if you need further help. 

The one new function we use below is `rename_with()` which allows you to rename all the variables with names of a certain pattern. In this case, we rename variables with an "E" at the end, replacing "E" with nothing "". Notice that I attached a *10* to the end of each variable that I will use in the gentrification measure to signify that it is for 2006-2010. 


```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Bring in 2006-2010 census tract data using the Census API 
ca.tracts10 <- get_acs(geography = "tract", 
              year = 2010,
              variables = c(medinc10 = "B19013_001", rent10  = "B25064_001",
                            houseval10 = "B25077_001", bachm = "B15002_015",
                            mastersm = "B15002_016", profm = "B15002_017",
                            phdm = "B15002_018", bachf = "B15002_032",
                            mastersf = "B15002_033", proff = "B15002_034",
                            phdf = "B15002_035", totcol = "B15002_001"),
              state = "CA",
              survey = "acs5",
              output = "wide",
              geometry = TRUE)

# Rename, calculate and keep essential vars. 
ca.tracts10 <- ca.tracts10 %>% 
  rename_with(~ sub("E$", "", .x), everything()) %>%
  mutate(pcol10 = 100*(bachm+mastersm+profm+phdm+bachf+mastersf+proff+phdf)/totcol) %>%
  select(c(GEOID,medinc10, rent10, houseval10, pcol10)) 
```


We then need to keep just the City of Fresno tracts.  Here we use familiar friends that were introduced in [Lab 6](https://crd150.github.io/lab6.html#Spatial_data_wrangling).

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Bring in city boundaries.  We'll use the boundaries for the final year, 2019
pl <- places(state = "CA", year = 2019, cb = TRUE)

# Keep Fresno city
fresno <- pl %>%
          filter(NAME == "Fresno")

#Keep tracts in Fresno 
fresno.tracts <- ms_clip(target = ca.tracts10, clip = fresno, remove_slivers = TRUE)
```


Second, we need to get the same variables but for the end of the period, which we define as 2015-2019. I've appended *19* to the end of each variable name to signify these are 2019 data.  This is done to distinguish these variables from the 2010 ACS data, which we'll be downloading later when we measure gentrification.  Also note that we don't need any spatial data since *ca.tracts10* is already an **sf** object, so we don't include the argument `geometry = TRUE`.

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Bring in 2015-2019 census tract data using the Census API 
ca.tracts19 <- get_acs(geography = "tract", 
              year = 2019,
              variables = c(tpop = "B03002_001", 
                            white = "B03002_003", black = "B03002_004",
                            asian = "B03002_006", hisp = "B03002_012",
                            medinc19 = "B19013_001", rent19  = "B25064_001",
                            houseval19 = "B25077_001", bach = "B15003_022",
                            masters = "B15003_023", prof = "B15003_024",
                            phd = "B15003_025", totcol = "B15003_001"),
              state = "CA",
              survey = "acs5",
              output = "wide")

# Rename, calculate and keep essential vars. 
ca.tracts19 <- ca.tracts19 %>% 
  rename_with(~ sub("E$", "", .x), everything()) %>%
  mutate(pwhite19 = 100*(white/tpop), pasian19 = 100*(asian/tpop), 
        pblack19 = 100*(black/tpop), phisp19 = 100*(hisp/tpop), 
        pcol19 = 100*(bach+masters+prof+phd)/totcol) %>%
  select(c(GEOID,pwhite19, pasian19, pblack19, phisp19,
           medinc19, rent19, houseval19, pcol19))  
```


Finally, let's join the two tract level data objects. The **sf** object *fresno.tracts* contains 2006-2010 ACS tract-level data.  We join the regular tibble *ca.tracts19*, which contains 2015-2019  ACS tract-level data, using `left_join()`.  The GEOID is *GEOID* in both *fresno.tracts* and *ca.tracts19*


```{r}
fresno.tracts <- fresno.tracts %>%
            left_join(ca.tracts19, by = "GEOID")
```

Make sure we've successfully merged all the variables we need by viewing the object *fresno.tracts*.

```{r}
glimpse(fresno.tracts)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **City level data**
\


As described in Handout 9, we need to compare neighborhoods to the entire City of Fresno to determine if a neighborhood is (1) eligible to gentrify and (2) if they are, whether they gentrified.  This means we need to bring in city data for the beginning (2006-10) and end (2015-19) periods. First, let's bring in 2006-2010 ACS data for all places in California using `get_acs()`. We use the argument `geography = "place"`. We specify these data as place level 2006-2010 by attaching a *c10* to the end of each variable.  We can't use`geometry = TRUE` to bring in spatial data for 2006-2010 city data because **tidycensus** does not provide spatial data for years before 2011.

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Bring in census tract data using the Census API 
ca.places10 <- get_acs(geography = "place", 
              year = 2010,
              variables = c(medincc10 = "B19013_001", rentc10  = "B25064_001",
                            housevalc10 = "B25077_001", bachm = "B15002_015",
                            mastersm = "B15002_016", profm = "B15002_017",
                            phdm = "B15002_018", bachf = "B15002_032",
                            mastersf = "B15002_033", proff = "B15002_034",
                            phdf = "B15002_035", totcol = "B15002_001"),
              state = "CA",
              survey = "acs5",
              output = "wide")

# Keep Fresno. Calculate and keep essential vars. Also take out zero population tracts
ca.places10 <- ca.places10 %>% 
    filter(NAME == "Fresno city, California") %>%
  rename_with(~ sub("E$", "", .x), everything()) %>%
  mutate(pcolc10 = 100*(bachm+mastersm+profm+phdm+bachf+mastersf+proff+phdf)/totcol) %>%
  select(c(GEOID,medincc10, rentc10, housevalc10, pcolc10)) 
```

<br>

We next need to bring in the last year (2015-2019) of city level data. We specify the data as place level 2015-2019 by attaching a *c19* to the end of each variable.  Here, we specify `geometry = TRUE` to get city spatial boundaries, and then filter to get just Fresno city.

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Bring in census tract data using the Census API 
ca.places19 <- get_acs(geography = "place", 
              year = 2019,
              variables = c(medincc19 = "B19013_001", rentc19  = "B25064_001",
                            housevalc19 = "B25077_001", bachc = "B15003_022",
                            mastersc = "B15003_023", profc = "B15003_024",
                            phdc = "B15003_025", totcolc = "B15003_001"),
              state = "CA",
              survey = "acs5",
              output = "wide",
              geometry = TRUE)

# Keep Fresno. Calculate and keep essential vars. Also keep just Fresno
fresno.city <- ca.places19 %>% 
  filter(NAME == "Fresno city, California") %>%
  rename_with(~ sub("E$", "", .x), everything()) %>%
  mutate(pcolc19 = 100*(bachc+mastersc+profc+phdc)/totcolc) %>%
  select(c(GEOID,medincc19, rentc19, housevalc19, pcolc19)) 
```

Finally, let's join the two city level data objects. The **sf** object *fresno.city* contains 2015-2019 ACS data just for Fresno city.  We join the regular tibble *ca.places10*, which contains 2006-2010  ACS city-level data, to *fresno.city* using `left_join()`.  The GEOID is *GEOID* in both files.


```{r}
fresno.city <- fresno.city %>%
            left_join(ca.places10, by = "GEOID")
```

Make sure to look at the data.

```{r}
glimpse(fresno.city)
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Joining the tract and city data**
\

We have tract and city level data at the beginning and end of the period in separate data objects (*fresno.tracts* and *fresno.city*). We now need to join all of them together into a single file.

When you view *fresno.tracts*, you'll notice that we don't have any variable indicating the city identifier to merge in city-level data.  Instead of `left_join()`, we instead use the `st_join()` function to join the city data to the tract data, which is a part of the **sf** package.   Here, rather than using an ID like GEOID, the joining is based on geographic location. We already used `st_join()` to join two spatial data object in [Lab 8a](https://crd150.github.io/lab8a.html#Read_in_the_data). Let's use it again.

```{r}
fresno.tracts <- fresno.tracts %>%
                st_join(fresno.city, left=FALSE)
```

This function joins the variables from *fresno.city* to the data frame *fresno.tracts*.

Look at the variable names to see if the join was successful.

```{r}
names(fresno.tracts)
```

We can also look at the data.

```{r}
glimpse(fresno.tracts)
```

We're done!

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Measuring Gentrification**
\

We've got all the data we need in one data object (*fresno.tracts*).  Now we can start constructing our gentrification measure.  


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Gentrification eligible tracts**
\

First, let's determine whether a tract is eligible to gentrify in the first place. A neighborhood is eligible for gentrification if its median household income is less than the city's median household income in 2006-2010. We create a variable named *eligible* that specifies whether a neighborhood is eligible or not using the `ifelse()` function within `mutate()`.  

```{r}
fresno.tracts <- fresno.tracts %>%
            mutate(eligible = ifelse(medinc10 < medincc10, 
                                     "Eligible", 
                                     "Not Eligible"))
```

Here, the `ifelse()` function tells R that if a tract's median household income *medinc10* is less than the city level median household income *medincc10*, label that neighborhood "Eligible".  Otherwise, label the neighborhood as  "Not Eligible". 

What is the percentage of neighborhoods that are eligible to gentrify? Here, we are summarizing a categorical variable, which we covered in [Lab 4](https://crd150.github.io/lab4.html#Categorical_variables). Let's put the results in a nice looking table by dropping the geometry using the function `st_drop_geometry()` and creating a nicely formatted table using the function `flextable()`.

```{r}
fresno.tracts %>%
  group_by(eligible) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(Percent = 100*(n / sum(n))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  flextable() %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) 
```

There is one tract missing a designation because it is missing values on median household income and median housing value (use `summary(fresno.tracts)` to detect missingness).

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Gentrifying tracts**
\

Next, we identify the eligible tracts that are gentrifying and the ones that are not gentrifying. An eligible neighborhood gentrifies if its change between 2006-2010 and 2015-2019 in median gross rent *or* median housing value is greater than the change in the city *and* the change in its percent of residents that have a college degree is more than the change in the city.

Let's first calculate the tract-level 2010 to 2019 differences in rent *rentch*, housing values *housech*, and percent with a college degree *pcolch*.


```{r}
fresno.tracts <- fresno.tracts %>%
            mutate(rentch = rent19-rent10, 
                   housech = houseval19-houseval10,
                   pcolch = pcol19-pcol10)
```

Next, we calculate the city-level differences in rent *rentchc*, housing values *housechc*, and percent with a college degree *pcolchc*.


```{r}
fresno.tracts <- fresno.tracts %>%
            mutate(rentchc = rentc19-rentc10, 
                   housechc = housevalc19-housevalc10,
                   pcolchc = pcolc19-pcolc10)
```

We now have all the pieces to construct a variable *gent* that labels tracts as "Not eligible", "Gentrifying", and "Not Gentrifying".  We do this using a set of `ifelse()` statements within `mutate()`.

```{r}
fresno.tracts <- fresno.tracts %>%
            mutate(gent = ifelse(eligible == "Not Eligible", "Not Eligible",
                          ifelse(eligible == "Eligible" & pcolch > pcolchc &
                                (rentch > rentchc | housech > housechc), "Gentrifying",
                                "Not Gentrifying")))
```



<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Examining Gentrification**
\

What is the percent of neighborhoods in Fresno that experienced gentrification? Let's put it in a nice looking table by dropping the geometry using the function `st_drop_geometry()` and using the function `flextable()`.

```{r}
fresno.tracts %>%
  group_by(gent) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(Percent = 100*(n / sum(n))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  flextable() %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) 
```

Approximately 17 percent of neighborhoods in Fresno experienced gentrification between 2019 and 2019.  Where are these neighborhoods located? Let's make a nice color patch map using our best buddy `tm_shape()`.



```{r warning = FALSE}
tm_shape(fresno.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(fill = "gent", 
              fill.scale = tm_scale(style = "cat",
                                    values = "paired"),
              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = "", frame = FALSE),
              col_alpha = 0) +
  tm_scalebar(breaks = c(0, 1, 2), text.size  = 0.75, 
              position = tm_pos_in("right", "bottom"))  +
  tm_compass(type = "4star", position = tm_pos_in("right", "top")) +
  tm_title("2010-2019 Gentrification Status in Fresno") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, scale = 0.7)
```


What are the mean percentages of residents that are Hispanic and non-Hispanic white, Black, and Asian in 2010 in each of the gentrification categories? 

```{r}
fresno.tracts %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(is.na(gent) == FALSE) %>%
  group_by(gent) %>%
  summarize("% White" = mean(pwhite19),
            "% Black" = mean(pblack19),
            "% Hispanic" = mean(phisp19),
            "% Asian" = mean(pasian19)) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) 
```

Exploring the association between gentrification and racial/ethnic composition, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and other conditions is a great idea for your final project.
