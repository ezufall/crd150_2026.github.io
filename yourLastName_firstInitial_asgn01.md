1. Look up the help documentation for the function `rep()`. Use this function to create the following 3 vectors.

a. [1] 0 0 0 0 0


``` r
#Insert your code here. Remember to include comments on what your code is doing.
```

b. [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3


``` r
#Insert your code here. Remember to include comments on what your code is doing.
```

c. [1] 6 7 7 8 8 8


``` r
#Insert your code here. Remember to include comments on what your code is doing.
```


2. Load the *mtcars* dataset by using the code `data(mtcars)`.  What are the units of observation? How many unit of observations does this dataset have? How many variables?  Remember that wherever possible, you will need to use R code to answer the questions. The dataset's help documentation `? mtcars` might be useful.


``` r
#Insert your code here. Remember to include comments on what your code is doing.
```

3. Explain what is the problem in each line of code below. Fix the code so it will run properly. 

a. my variable <- 3


``` r
#Insert your code here. Remember to include comments on what your code is doing.
```

b. seq(1, 10 by = 2)


``` r
#Insert your code here. Remember to include comments on what your code is doing.
```

c. Class(c(1,2,3))


``` r
#Insert your code here. Remember to include comments on what your code is doing.
```

4. Have you ever used R before? If so, to what extent? Have you used any of the following programs: Excel, SPSS, Stata, SAS, Python, Matlab? If so, to what extent?  For each program, choose one of the following options: (a) Never used, (b) Beginner, (c) Basic competence, (d) Intermediate, (e) Advanced.  

5. Describe what you are hoping to get out of this class (besides a pass or A)?
